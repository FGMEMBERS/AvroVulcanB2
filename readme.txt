A. V. Roe Vulcan B2
===================

The Avro Vulcan was probably the most famous of the U.K. V-force aircraft,
originally deisgned to deliver atomic weapson in the early 1950s. A huge
four-engined, subsonic delta bomber, it was originally designed for high-level
delivery. Due to improvements in Russion AA technology, the V-force was
re-trained for low-level flying, for which the Vulcan proved to have a much more
robust airframe than the Victor or Valiant.

While being retired for service in 1982 (to be replaced by the Tornado), the
Vulcan was finally used in anger during the Falklands Conflict. The "Black Buck"
missions flew flew from Ascension Island to bomb Port Stanley runway and take
out anti-aircraft radar systems. At the time, the mission was the longest
bombing mission ever undertaken and involved incredible logistics and mutliple
in-flight refuelding from Victor aircraft.

This particular Vulcan model is intended to match XM597, one of the aircraft
used in the Black Buch missions. It now resides at The Museum of Flight in East
Fortune.

Systems
=======

The Vulcan has 4 engines, airbrakes, a brake chute, and no flaps.

V-speeds can be found in the Aircraft Help within FG.

including the aircrew manual and lots of technical information.

Jonathan Harris very kindly GPL'd his X-plane Vulcan which this model is based
upon.

AJ for the Lighning, which I borrowed many dials and JSBSim code from.


To Do
=====
- Cockpit - Many of the dials are from the Lightning and so cover very high
            speeds, G-forces.
- Fuel System - I've simplified the fuel system from 14 tanks to 4. The fuel
                system is very complex and needs it's own panel
- Airbrakes - These have been simplified too. They should have two positions
              35 and 55 degrees, with the 55 degrees becomeing 85 when
              the undercarriage is down
- Electrical - There is currently no electrical system
- Chute      - The chute doesn't appear to have any affect
- Textures   - They look pretty rough, don't they...
